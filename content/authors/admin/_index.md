I'm a climate scientist, interested in water on land and the interactions between freshwater, human management and climate change. In my research, I employ modelling techniques, ranging from the [Community Earth System Model](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/), the land model [Community Terrestrial Systems Model](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/land/), the river-routing model mizuRoute to impact models from the [ISIMIP project](https://www.isimip.org/).  

Currently I am obtaining my PhD at the [Department of Hydrology and Hydraulic Engineering](http://www.hydr.vub.ac.be/), Vrije Universiteit Brussel, funded by a personal PhD fellowship from the Research Foundation Flanders [FWO](https://www.fwo.be/en/). 

In my PhD, I investigated the role of reservoirs in a changing climate.
