abstract: Despite great advances, experiments concerning the response of ecosystems
  to climate change still face considerable challenges, including the high complexity
  of climate change in terms of environmental variables, constraints in the number
  and amplitude of climate treatment levels, and the limited scope of responses and
  interactions covered. Drawing on the expertise of researchers from a variety of
  disciplines, this Perspective outlines how computational and technological advances
  can help in designing experiments that can contribute to overcoming these challenges,
  and also outlines a first application of such an experimental design.
