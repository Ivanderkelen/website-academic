abstract: Empirical evidence demonstrates that lakes and reservoirs are warming across
  the globe. Consequently, there is an increased need to project future changes in
  lake thermal structure and resulting changes in lake biogeochemistry in order to
  plan for the likely impacts. Previous studies of the impacts of climate change on
  lakes have often relied on a single model forced with limited scenario-driven projections
  of future climate for a relatively small number of lakes. As a result, our understanding
  of the effects of climate change on lakes is fragmentary, based on scattered studies
  using different data sources and modelling protocols, and mainly focused on individual
  lakes or lake regions. This has precluded identification of the main impacts of
  climate change on lakes at global and regional scales and has likely contributed
  to the lack of lake water quality considerations in policy-relevant documents, such
  as the Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
  Here, we describe a simulation protocol developed by the Lake Sector of the Inter-Sectoral
  Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) for simulating climate change impacts
  on lakes using an ensemble of lake models and climate change scenarios. The protocol
  prescribes lake simulations driven by climate forcing from gridded observations
  and different Earth system models under various Representative Greenhouse Gas Concentration
  Pathways, all consistently bias-corrected on a 0.5° x 0.5° global grid. In ISIMIP
  phase 2, 11 lake models were forced with these data to project the thermal structure
  of 62 well-studied lakes where data were available for calibration under historical
  conditions, and for nearly 17,500 lakes using uncalibrated models and forcing data
  from the global grid where lakes are present. In ISIMIP phase 3, this approach was
  expanded to consider more lakes, more models, and more processes. The ISIMIP Lake
  Sector is the largest international effort to project future water temperature,
  thermal structure, and ice phenology of lakes at local and global scales and paves
  the way for future simulations of the impacts of climate change on water quality
  and biogeochemistry in lakes.
